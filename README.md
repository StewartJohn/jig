# Teh Jigz UP

This is a Jekyll installation that uses a Google Sheet as a database, rendering the content to look like a comic strip. It is meant to be a fun way to teach the power of using Github as free project hosting service, Jekyll as a content management system, and Google Sheet as a data store.

- You can view the main project website at: https://teh-jigz-up.github.io/teh-jigz-up/
- You can view my Twine "jig" at: https://stewartjohn.github.io/jig/
- The Google Sheet template is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17PQQpUwl_uQzQeFrj4gZtQ1BphuhfFf5OYW2Neob-hs/edit

To make your own copy you just:

1) Copy the Google Sheet with this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17PQQpUwl_uQzQeFrj4gZtQ1BphuhfFf5OYW2Neob-hs/copy
2) Fork this repository, or you can download zip, and upload to a new repository, as Github will only allow you to fork once!
3) Once you've copied you just edit the _config.yaml file, following the instructions in there to paste the URL of YOUR Google Sheet, and change the name of the Github repository (if you want).

Then you can edit the content in the spreadsheet, making it your own comic. You can add or remove as many sheets as you like, but each one will only show six frames.

This is a work in progress, and you can leave any questions on the Github issues for THIS repository (not yours).
